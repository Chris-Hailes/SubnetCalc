# Visual Subnet Calculator

Visual Subnet Calculator is a modernized tool based on the original work by [davidc](https://github.com/davidc/subnets).
It strives to be a tool for quickly designing networks and collaborating on that design with others. It focuses on
expediting the work of network administrators, not academic subnetting math.

## Design Tenants

The following tenants are the most important values that drive the design of the tool. New features, pull requests, etc
should align to these tenants, or propose an adjustment to the tenants.

- **Simplicity is king.** Network admins are busy and Visual Subnet Calculator should always be easy for FIRST TIME USERS to
  quickly and intuitively use.
- **Subnetting is design work.** Promote features that enhance visual clarity and easy mental processing of even the most
  complex architectures.
- **Users control the data.** We store nothing, but provide convenient ways for users to save and share their designs.
- **Embrace community contributions.** Consider and respond to all feedback and pull requests in the context of these 
  tenants.
